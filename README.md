# 📘 Supervised Learning (Part I of the Repository)

## 🧠 What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised Learning is one of the most fundamental approaches in machine learning. In this paradigm, we train models using **labeled datasets**, where each example consists of an input and a known output (label). The objective is to learn a function that maps inputs to outputs and generalizes well to unseen data.

This section is the **first chapter of the repository** and provides a thorough exploration of supervised learning models, grouped by algorithmic family. It covers both theoretical and practical aspects of each model, along with Python notebooks and usage examples.

## ✅ Closing This Chapter

This concludes the **Supervised Learning** section of the repository.

You now have a solid foundation on:
- The most important classical ML models
- How to evaluate and improve them
- When and why to use each approach

👉 Next up: **Unsupervised Learning** — where no labels are required, and structure must be discovered from raw data.
